# Next.js Best Practices

## Project Structure
- Use the App Router directory structure
- Place components in `app` directory for route-specific components
- Place shared components in `components` directory
- Place utilities and helpers in `lib` directory
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)

## Components
- Use Server Components by default
- Mark client components explicitly with 'use client'
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Place static content and interfaces at file end

## Performance
- Optimize images: Use WebP format, size data, lazy loading
- Minimize use of 'useEffect' and 'setState'
- Favor Server Components (RSC) where possible
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Data Fetching
- Use Server Components for data fetching when possible
- Implement proper error handling for data fetching
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

## Routing
- Use the App Router conventions
- Implement proper loading and error states for routes
- Use dynamic routes appropriately
- Handle parallel routes when needed

## Forms and Validation
- Use Zod for form validation
- Implement proper server-side validation
- Handle form errors appropriately
- Show loading states during form submission

## State Management
- Minimize client-side state
- Use React Context sparingly
- Prefer server state when possible
- Implement proper loading states

# Gitflow Workflow Rules

## Main Branches

### main (or master)
- Contains production-ready code
- Never commit directly to main
- Only accepts merges from:
  - hotfix/* branches
  - release/* branches
- Must be tagged with version number after each merge

### develop
- Main development branch
- Contains latest delivered development changes
- Source branch for feature branches
- Never commit directly to develop

## Supporting Branches

### feature/*
- Branch from: develop
- Merge back into: develop
- Naming convention: feature/[issue-id]-descriptive-name
- Example: feature/123-user-authentication
- Must be up-to-date with develop before creating PR
- Delete after merge

### release/*
- Branch from: develop
- Merge back into: 
  - main
  - develop
- Naming convention: release/vX.Y.Z
- Example: release/v1.2.0
- Only bug fixes, documentation, and release-oriented tasks
- No new features
- Delete after merge

### hotfix/*
- Branch from: main
- Merge back into:
  - main
  - develop
- Naming convention: hotfix/vX.Y.Z
- Example: hotfix/v1.2.1
- Only for urgent production fixes
- Delete after merge

## Commit Messages

- Format: `type(scope): description`
- Types:
  - feat: New feature
  - fix: Bug fix
  - docs: Documentation changes
  - style: Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
  - refactor: Code refactoring
  - test: Adding tests
  - chore: Maintenance tasks

## Version Control

### Semantic Versioning
- MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
- MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality
- PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Pull Request Rules

1. All changes must go through Pull Requests
2. Required approvals: minimum 1
3. CI checks must pass
4. No direct commits to protected branches (main, develop)
5. Branch must be up to date before merging
6. Delete branch after merge

## Branch Protection Rules

### main & develop
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Include administrators in restrictions
- No force pushes
- No deletions

## Release Process

1. Create release branch from develop
2. Bump version numbers
3. Fix any release-specific issues
4. Create PR to main
5. After merge to main:
   - Tag release
   - Merge back to develop
   - Delete release branch

## Hotfix Process

1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Fix the issue
3. Bump patch version
4. Create PR to main
5. After merge to main:
   - Tag release
   - Merge back to develop
   - Delete hotfix branch

# Code Quality Guidelines

## Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

## File-by-File Changes
Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

## No Apologies
Never use apologies.

## No Understanding Feedback
Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

## No Whitespace Suggestions
Don't suggest whitespace changes.

## No Summaries
Don't summarize changes made.

## No Inventions
Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

## No Unnecessary Confirmations
Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

## Preserve Existing Code
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

## Single Chunk Edits
Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

## No Implementation Checks
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

## No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

## Provide Real File Links
Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

## No Current Implementation
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

# Clean Code Guidelines

## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

## Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names
